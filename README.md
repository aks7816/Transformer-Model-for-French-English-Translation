##Transformer Model Project

###This project involves training a Transformer model on a subset of data (1,000 samples for training and 500 for validation) using PyTorch. The model is configured with dynamic vocabulary handling for French and English and is evaluated with a separate validation loop to ensure unbiased performance metrics.
